# **Agoric Asset Chatbot**

Agoric Asset Chatbot is a decentralized application (Dapp) powered by the **Agoric smart contract platform**. It enables users to interact with a chatbot to seamlessly **buy** or **sell assets** in a decentralized marketplace. The chatbot provides an intuitive interface for asset trading, guiding users through transactions and ensuring secure, blockchain-backed trades.
